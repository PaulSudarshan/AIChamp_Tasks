Summary
One who desires to learn and acquire knowledge does so by finding
his own ways and exploring opportunities. As an undergrad student I
have embraced every opportunity that I ever came across and these
have helped me learn and grow.  By ''learning'' I do not simply mean
the academic knowledge one desires to acquire instead, I also refer
to every life lessons and experiences that form an integral part of
development.
As a research aspirant, I wish to complete my masters abroad
and pursue a career in research in the Machine Learning(ML) and
Artificial Intelligence(AI) domain and contribute to these domains.
