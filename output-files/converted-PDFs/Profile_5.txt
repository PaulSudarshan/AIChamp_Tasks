Summary
Hey guys! I'm Rishabh. '        .⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Like you, I'm a man who loves to play with data and to devise ways
to solve a major pain-point.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
It was back in 2014 that I was watching the TV Series - Person of
Interest, that I was introduced to Artificial Intelligence and its mind-
numbing scale.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I couldn't help but enroll myself in an intensive Data Science
program at CDAC, Pune, that very summer.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Upon finishing my program, I bought books over books to deepen my
understanding of every domain of Data Science.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
It was in late 2017 that a few of my colleagues mentioned how
they fear to become irrelevant in the market as they lack any
understanding of AI.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Just like me, they couldn't find any well put-together online resource
that could help them learn Data Science in a disciplined manner.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
They asked me to help them out.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
THAT WAS MY EUREKA MOMENT!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
After helping over a dozen of my colleagues, in early 2018, I put
together an end-to-end Data Science program that cuts through the
noise in the AI world and provides an ultimate shortcut to become a
full-stack Data Scientist in 6 months.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
My end goal is to work on gigantic AI projects. And for that, I'd need
an elite group of Data Scientists who understand the domain inside
and out.⁣⁣
