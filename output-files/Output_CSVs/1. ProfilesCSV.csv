Founder at THE DatumGuy

Summary
Hey guys! I'm Rishabh. '        .⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Like you, I'm a man who loves to play with data and to devise ways
to solve a major pain-point.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
It was back in 2014 that I was watching the TV Series - Person of
Interest, that I was introduced to Artificial Intelligence and its mind-
numbing scale.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I couldn't help but enroll myself in an intensive Data Science
program at CDAC, Pune, that very summer.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Upon finishing my program, I bought books over books to deepen my
understanding of every domain of Data Science.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
It was in late 2017 that a few of my colleagues mentioned how
they fear to become irrelevant in the market as they lack any
understanding of AI.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Just like me, they couldn't find any well put-together online resource
that could help them learn Data Science in a disciplined manner.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
They asked me to help them out.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
THAT WAS MY EUREKA MOMENT!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
After helping over a dozen of my colleagues, in early 2018, I put
together an end-to-end Data Science program that cuts through the
noise in the AI world and provides an ultimate shortcut to become a
full-stack Data Scientist in 6 months.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
My end goal is to work on gigantic AI projects. And for that, I'd need
an elite group of Data Scientists who understand the domain inside
and out.⁣⁣

One who desires to learn and acquire knowledge does so by finding
his own ways and exploring opportunities. As an undergrad student I
have embraced every opportunity that I ever came across and these

the academic knowledge one desires to acquire instead, I also refer
to every life lessons and experiences that form an integral part of
development.
As a research aspirant, I wish to complete my masters abroad
and pursue a career in research in the Machine Learning(ML) and

Providing brief insight into the project, it uses docker to virtualize the hardware
platform of the system and with the help of container technology a web-server
is developed to host web-applications while exposing the local domain name
by using ngrok application. All of this might look simple and easy; However,
the downside of this methodology is when the traffic to the web-application
increases causing the website to malfunction. 

In this case, by deploying our containers to the Kubernetes platform and
managing all the nodes through a single interface structure provided by
Cisco is a perfect choice. This solves the problem of scalability and provides
redundant applications when deployed into the production environments.
Integrating the Kubernetes cluster into the Application Centric Infrastructure
provided by Cisco enables the visibility of the nodes while performing the
distributed tasks given by the Master node.

Also considering and generating various major reducible and irreducible
backgrounds in the channel for my analysis (ZZ* ,ttbar etc).
Wrote the code right from the scratch in the language C++ . 

Background process generations are used for analysing and removing the
similar processes which are replicating the Higgs Decay Channel .

Satisfactory results came in the project .

Summary
3D Medical image analysis for telesurgical vision system and
diagnostic purpose is my area of interest. With two internships and
two projects in hands relevant to medical image processing, I am
pursuing my master’s in computer engineering.           ""Let your
innovation be with compassion and passion""

My passion for innovation is about medical image analysis. I fell in
love with this field of telesurgical vision after attending a workshop
conducted by LANCET Commission on Global Surgery for surgical
services in rural regions. I am in my pursuit to innovate for tele
surgical vision system.

Currently I am doing master’s in computer engineering with special
focus on image analysis. As a part of curriculum, I did courses and
projects related to medical image processing and image processing.
I had a chance to do Coop in Promaxo where I learned about 3D
medical image processing and python. 

I did my undergrad in Electronics and communication engineering
with a specialization in signal processing. The part of the curriculum
includes projects, seminar presentations and paper presentations
which enhanced my skills for real world problem. One of my favourite
projects is Lung cancer detection using decision tree based SVM
where I earned experience about image data manipulation, machine
learning. Presented two papers and got published in IEEE journal.
I had a two weeks internship training on image processing in UNIQ
technologies where I learned about image processing using matlab.

The most valuable achievement that I would say is the winning
in Hackathon conducted by LANCET Commission on Global
Surgery for surgical services in rural regions. We as a team named
'Lungathon'  presented about the lung cancer detection using
Decision tree based SVM algorithm and won the second place.
